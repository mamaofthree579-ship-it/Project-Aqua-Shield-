# Crisis-Zone Adapted Water Treatment Method
For conflict or blockade zones where materials, fuel, and movement are limited.

---

## Tier 1: Settling + Cloth Filtration
1. Collect water.
2. Let sit 6–12 hours.
3. Pour upper water through 4–8 layers of cloth.

Removes most large contaminants without moving far.

---

## Tier 2: Sand + Charcoal Micro-Filter
If charcoal exists (cooking residue):
- Crush charcoal
- Layer in any bottle or container above cloth & sand

Improves safety and taste.

---

## Tier 3: Disinfection
Choose what’s locally possible:
- SODIS (best in siege conditions)
- Boiling (if fuel safe to use)
- Chlorine drops or tablets (if available)

---

## Warnings
If water smells like:
- fuel  
- solvent  
- gasoline  

→ Do NOT drink. No DIY method removes chemical contamination.

If heavy metals (lead, arsenic) are suspected → require advanced filtration.
