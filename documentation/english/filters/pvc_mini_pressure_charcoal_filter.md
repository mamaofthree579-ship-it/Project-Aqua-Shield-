## Assembly
1. Clean all components. Rinse charcoal.  
2. Drill small holes in one cap to act as inlet (or leave a center hole).  
3. Insert a cloth pad into the inlet cap to hold charcoal.  
4. Fill the tube with charcoal, packing lightly but evenly.  
5. Place a cloth pad on top then attach the outlet cap (can be perforated or mesh).  
6. Secure caps (screw or tape). Test for leaks.

## Use
- Attach inline to small hose or hold under faucet.  
- Flow will be faster than gravity filters but slower than direct tap.  
- Discard first 1–2 liters on assembly and after charcoal changes.

---

## Maintenance
- Replace charcoal every 2–6 weeks depending on turbidity and use.  
- Replace cloth pads weekly or when clogged.  
- If flow reduces substantially, disassemble, clean caps and repack or replace charcoal.

---

## Safety & Limitations
- **Benefits:** better taste, odor, some organics removed, reduced turbidity and rust.  
- **Limitations:** does not reliably remove viruses; requires disinfection for drinking.
