# Silver-Coated Ceramic Disk (Small Porous Pre-Filter)
**Purpose:** Small ceramic disk/puck that reduces bacteria & sediments from tap water as a pre-filter; can be used in cups, funnels, or bottle necks.

---

## BOM
- Clean clay (local) — small amount  
- Burnable organic (sawdust, rice hulls, fine straw) — small amount  
- Water — to mix  
- Metal container or small kiln for firing  
- (Optional) Colloidal silver or silver nitrate solution — tiny amount (medical-grade if available)  
**Estimated cost:** $0–$2 (depends on firing access)

**Cautions:** Colloidal silver increases antimicrobial effect but should be used cautiously. Do not overuse silver coatings due to ingestion risks.

## Making Steps
1. Mix clay + sawdust (3:1 clay:organic by volume). Add water to make workable dough.  
2. Form disk 3–6 cm diameter, 0.5–1 cm thick with small holes if desired.  
3. Air dry 2–3 days.  
4. Fire in kiln or metal barrel kiln until fully sintered (temperature targets vary; small-scale firing to harden). The sawdust burns out leaving pores.  
5. Optional: rinse and coat inside face lightly with medical colloidal silver and let dry.

---

## Use
- Place disk in funnel or bottle neck; pour water through slowly.  
- Disk acts as low-flow porous filter and can be rinsed externally.

---

## Maintenance & Replacement
- Rinse externally weekly.  
- Replace if cracked, visibly clogged, or after ~3–6 months depending on use.  
- If silver-coated, replace according to safe-use guidance (medical advice).

---

## Safety & Limitations
- **Removes:** sediment and many bacteria (not guaranteed).  
- **Does NOT remove:** chemicals, heavy metals, salts.  
- Use in combination with disinfection.
