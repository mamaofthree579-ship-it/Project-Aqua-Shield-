# Zero-Rust Magnet Pre-Filter
**Purpose:** Capture iron/rust particles from tap water using simple magnets to improve taste and reduce metallic sediment in distribution systems with rusty pipes.

---

## BOM
- Strong magnets (from old speakers, motors) — 1–4  
- Small plastic chamber (cut bottle or PVC) — 1  
- Metal mesh or tight cloth — 1 piece  
- Tape or simple sealant — as needed  
**Estimated cost:** free–$1 (magnets scavenged)

## Assembly
1. Place magnet(s) inside or on the outside wall of a small plastic chamber where water will slow down (e.g., cut bottle). If inside, enclose in a protective non-reactive sleeve (plastic) so metal debris can stick but not enter water.  
2. Add a mesh or cloth downstream to catch larger particles.  
3. Secure in-line or hold under tap.

---

## How it works
- Iron/rust particles are magnetic and will adhere to magnets as water passes.  
- Mesh captures remaining particles.

---

## Maintenance
- Remove and clean magnets weekly (wipe off rust).  
- Replace mesh if clogged.

---

## Safety & Limitations
- **Works well for:** iron/rust, metallic sediment, reducing metallic taste.  
- **Does NOT remove:** dissolved iron (non-particulate), bacteria, chemicals.  
- Use as pre-filter before charcoal or disinfection.
