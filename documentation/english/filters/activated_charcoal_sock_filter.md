# Activated Charcoal Sock Filter
**Purpose:** Low-cost inline finishing filter for tap water to reduce chlorine taste, odors, organics, rust particles and some microplastics. Good as a faucet adaptor or under-sink short-term filter.

---

## Bill of Materials (BOM)
- Cotton sock or muslin cloth tube — 1 (reuse)  
- Activated charcoal (granular or crushed wood charcoal) — ½–1 cup  
- Rubber band or zip-tie — 1  
- Short rigid tube or bottle top to make an adapter (optional) — 1  
**Estimated cost:** $1–$3 (varies by region)

**Local substitutes:** use charcoal from cooking stoves (crushed, rinsed) or charcoal briquettes if no activated charcoal; use tight-woven cloth (clean sock, old t-shirt).

## Assembly (no special tools)
1. Clean all items. Rinse charcoal to remove dust (quick rinse).  
2. Place a small folded cloth or cotton at one end of the sock to act as a prefilter (push it inside).  
3. Fill the sock ½–¾ full with the crushed activated charcoal. Leave some space for water flow.  
4. Fold or tie the sock end and secure with a rubber band / zip-tie.  
5. Optional: insert a rigid small tube or cut bottle cap to make a faucet adapter so it fits under the tap. Tape or secure as needed.

---

## How to Use
- Attach to faucet, or hold under the tap so water flows through charcoal column.  
- Run water through for 10–30 seconds before first use to clear dust.  
- Use as a finishing filter—after sediment removal if water is turbid.

---

## First-Flush / Quick Field Test
1. Pour 1–2 liters through and discard.  
2. Taste test: should remove strong chlorine smell/taste.  
3. Visual: little black dust in first flush is normal — run until clear.

---

## Maintenance & Replacement
- Rinse charcoal weekly; squeeze cloth and rinse externally (do not let charcoal escape).  
- Replace charcoal every 2–4 weeks depending on use and water quality.  
- Replace entire sock if torn, smelly, or after ~1 month of daily use.

---

## Safety & Limitations
- **Removes:** chlorine taste/odor, many organics, rust particles, microplastics.  
- **Does NOT remove:** viruses, many bacteria (partial), heavy metals, dissolved salts.  
- Use **in combination** with disinfection (boiling, SODIS, chlorine) for drinking water.
