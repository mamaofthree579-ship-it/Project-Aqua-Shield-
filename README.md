# ProjectAquaShield

## 🌱 Mission
ProjectAquaShield is a community-driven, open-source water filtration project. We build and share robust, repairable filter designs and documentation so communities, NGOs, local governments, and volunteers can restore access to safer water — with dignity, transparency, and long-term resilience.

> This project is about restoration and community empowerment, not charity. All designs, data, and training materials are open-source and intended to remain that way.

## 🔧 What this repository provides
- Low-tech and 3D-printable water filter designs
- Region-specific installation & safety guides
- Replacement-cycle & maintenance frameworks
- Community training materials and outreach assets
- Transparent, reproducible filter performance data

## 🌎 Who it's for
Communities, NGOs, engineers, educators, volunteers, and local governments.
